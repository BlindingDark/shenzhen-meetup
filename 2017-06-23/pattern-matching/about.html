<h1>Shenzhen Elixir Meetup</h1>

<blockquote>
This group is for anyone interested in learning the Elixir programming language and meeting other Elixir/Erlang enthusiasts. We're all new to Elixir here, so welcome anybody to come along, learn and share their experiences with Elixir and/or Erlang.

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain. Join this group to learn more about Elixir!
